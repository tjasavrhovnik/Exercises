(* A priority queue (PQ) is a data structure that stores elements in order of
   "priority". Elements with high priority are available before elements with
   low priority. *)
type comparison = LT | EQ | GT

(* To talk about priorities, we define a type of comparisons, and a signature
   of types with comparison.
   Note that we do not want to hide the implementation of the type t here
   because we want to use the compare function on values of type t *outside the
   module*. The reason that we leave it abstract here is because it is simply
   unknown at this time. *)
module type Comparable = sig
    type t
    val compare : t -> t -> comparison
  end

(* Implement a module that can compare integers. *)

module Cmp_Int = struct
  type t = int
  let compare x y = if x < y then LT else if x = y then EQ else GT
end


(* example: *)
(* let _ = Cmp_Int.compare 9000 42;; *)

(* When we prescribe the signature of a module we have to be careful which
   types we make abstract. If a type is abstract in the signature, we can still
   export explicitly via the "with type t = int" clause (because the
   implementation of int is known outside the module). *)
(* module Cmp_Int_prescribed = (Cmp_Int : Comparable with type t = int) *)

(* example: *)
(* let _ = Cmp_Int_prescribed.compare (-9000) 42;; *)

(* Now let's implement a module that compares strings. To write your compare
   function, use the "compare" function from the "Pervasives" module of
   built-in OCaml functions. It compares strings s and t lexicographically,
   yielding -1 if s < t, 0 if s = t and 1 otherwise. *)
module Cmp_String = struct
  type t = String
  let compare x y = match Pervasives.compare x y with
    | -1 -> LT
	| 0 -> EQ
	| 1 -> GT
	| n -> failwith ("unexpected result from Pervasives.compare: " ^
	                    (string_of_int n))

end

(* Write an example! *)


(* A functor is simply a function on the module level. We can define a functor
   that takes a Comparable module as an argument and returns another
   Comparable module on the same carrier type but with inverted order relation.
 *)

module Cmp_inv (Cmp : Comparable) : Comparable with type t = Cmp.t  = struct
  type t = Cmp.t
  let compare x y = match Cmp.compare x y with
    | LT -> GT
	| EQ -> EQ
	| GT -> LT
end

let f (x : int) = (
  -x
)

(* To use a functor, like other functions, we have to apply it. One difference
   with other OCaml functions is that we need parenthesis around the
   arguments. *)


module Cmp_Int_inv = Cmp_inv (Cmp_Int)
let _ = Cmp_Int.compare (-9000) 42;;
let _ = Cmp_Int_inv.compare (-9000) 42;;


(* Finally, here is the signature of a priority queue. We have a type of priority queues h, a type
   of elements el, an empty priority queue, and operations to push onto and safely pop
   elements off the priority queue. Pop returns the new priority queue and the highest-priority
   element if the priority queue is non-empty. *)
(*
module type Priority_Queue = sig
    type h
    type el
    val empty : h
    val pop : h -> (h * el) option
    val push : ...
  end
 *)


(* We can implement a priority queue as a sorted list. Write a functor that takes a
   Comparable module as an argument and implements a priority queue with Cmp.t lists as
   carrier. Be careful about which types you want to hide. *)
(*
module Sorted_List_Priority_Queue ... = struct
  ...
end
*)

(* Apply your functor to build a priority queue of integers, and a priority queue of strings. *)


(* Write some examples using push and pop! *)


(* Write a functor To_List that takes an implementation of Priority_Queue as an argument
   and returns a module with a "to_list" function, that takes a priority queue and yields
   all of its elements as a list. *)

(* module To_List ... *)


(* Let's test your To_List functor! Like any other values, modules can also be
   used locally. We just have to distinguish the let binding with an additional
   "module" keyword. Short variable and module names at toplevel are a mistake
   but are acceptable locally when we don't have to remember what they mean for
   too long. *)
(*
let _ =
  let h = List.fold_left IntH.push IntH.empty [1; 0; 9; 2] in
  let module TL = To_List(IntH) in
  TL.to_list h

  let module H = Sorted_List_Priority_Queue (Cmp_inv(Cmp_Int)) in
